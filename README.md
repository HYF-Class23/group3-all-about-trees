## General info

> Trees, the majestic giants of the plant kingdom, stand as silent sentinels of
> nature's grace. With their sturdy trunks and verdant canopies, they offer
> shelter to countless creatures and contribute to the oxygen we breathe. From
> the delicate blossoms of cherry trees to the towering strength of oak, each
> species brings a unique charm to the landscape. Trees play a vital role in
> maintaining ecological balance, preventing soil erosion, and providing shade
> in the heat of summer. Their leaves whisper in the breeze, telling stories of
> seasons gone by. In every forest, trees form a resilient community, showcasing
> the beauty of life rooted firmly in the earth.
